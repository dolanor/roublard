# Roublard

> Roublard is the french name of the Rogue class in DnD

Rogue-like game based on the [tutorial series from IdiotCoder/FatOldYeti](https://www.fatoldyeti.com/posts/roguelike-tutorial-0/).

As Ebiten didn't work on my fresh setup of Ubuntu 24.04
(see [here](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/issues/3304)), I decided to 
use http://g3n.rocks since I'm following the project for a while and wanted to
play with it for years.

So here is my attempt to have a playable base for a Rogue-like game, in Go, with
g3n and ECS.

It includes assets from PolyHaven and @mz4250.
